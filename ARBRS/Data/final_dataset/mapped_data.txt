Heavy gamers may feel otherwise.6) Camera Setup is top notch in this budget. Portrait mode, Bokeh and other modes. Good colors.7) Good CPU and GPU performance but cud have been better a little.8) For sibgle SIM users there is hybrid SIM slot with memory card option, but Dual SIM users can be disappointed. (I haven't seen many phones with SIM card + Dual SIM option, though there are specific models available)9) Good customisation option but I would rather go with full customisation like Asus or go Pure Android like OnePlus not inbetween.Cons:1) Still on Android 7, but company has released Oreo Beta rom so hopefully that will becom a another plus for 7x2) We are in 2018 and still Companies go for MicroUSB and Not Type - C Port is really killing the products to be on top of the list.3) Bigger the battery, Fasther the Charging should be. Can not wait 4 hours to get phone fully charged. Fast Charging is a necessity where technology is getting wireless and AI is the new hieght to be achieved.4) Touch sensor is little out of league compared to other Brands. Sometimes have to touch multiple times in the center of the screen for a task. Can be tweaked in OTA Udates.5) I really miss the notification Slider from OnePlus. Makes your life so easy. Many wont mind it.6) Front Facing Camera is 60% of its capacity can have some OTA of that too.7) RAM management can be better.

A full metal body is just dull in my opinion. Physical build of this phone is very good.When it comes to software, Oxygen OS kicks ass. I won't do the fanboy pitch but I did love a couple of things.1. Quick Settings tile to toggle data between 2 SIMs.  (this is just brilliant) I don't know if any other phone offers this.2. Reading mode. I do a lot of reading so this is just great to have.3. Single tap data toggle is back again. I used to root my phones just so I could do this.4. In almost 4 months of use, I barely saw the phone stutter and I have 129 apps installed.5. I saved the best for the last, Dash Charging. Wireless charging is fancy but it charges very slow. I'm glad OnePlus decided to include a Dash Charger rather than making consumers buy an additional accessory.Can't say much about the camera as I'm not a photography nut but it does take good pictures in well lit places.My only hope is that this phone gets Android P.
